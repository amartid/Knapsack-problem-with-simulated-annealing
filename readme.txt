Based on various tests, the algorithm was adapted to its current form. It was observed that, for the given example with a temperature of To=1000 and alpha=0.7, there was a profit improvement for temperature values ranging between 200 and 100. As a result, we conducted experimental modifications by changing the values of To to 200 and alpha to 0.999. This was done in order to observe the effects of small temperature reduction rates on the algorithm's performance.
